            <p class="card-text"> &nbsp;At SPARK, we strive to do the extra-ordinary. We have sparked our curiosity and have explored new opportunities to create and design a website. And there is always a WHY. WHY did we choose to use yellow? WHY did we choose this font? WHY did we use this prototype? And WHY is this final website so different?</p>

            <p class="card-text">At first, we have created a content flow. This created a good overview of what contents we wanted our website to have, and made it easy create a task flow, prototype and official website afterwards.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Secondly, we have created a task flow. This shows which page is connected to which page/link. As can be seen, we wanted to link all the pages to a NavBar, so that it is easy to access. Besides, the NavBar creates a quick and easy overview of everything our website, and our brand, has to offer.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The fonts we have used for the website are ROBOTO. This font is, contrary to our design, very simple. We have chosen this font so to keep the attention to the design and our brand itself. We do not want to take away any attention of the brand by using a special or outstanding font. This simple font creates balance and consistency throughout the whole website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				<p class="card-text">The fonts we have used for our logo, and thus our brand, are Novecento Sans Narrow Book. Another font that is allowed to be used is Novecento Sans Book. These fonts are, same as the font used for the website, very simple. This to attract the viewers attention to our logo immediately, to the SPARK itself. Automatically, when the spark catches the viewers eyes, they will read the word SPARK.</p>

				<p class="card-text">The color pallette we have used is in its essence very simple, with one outstanding color, yellow. Yellow is the key color for our brand, as the spark is yellow as well. It immediately catches the eye, and it is a color that is easily connected to a certain brand, our brand. The other colors are more natural colors, and are to keep the yellow in balance. Since a website, and design, with a lot of bright colors can be very distasteful and harsh on the eye, we have chosen to compliment the yellow with more natural colors.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">User Testing Report</h2>
            <p class="card-text">To create a website as user-friendly as possible, we have conducted usability tests, using a prototype created in <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/649918a3-39ae-4fc9-a5d0-d17c804d8a26-31ca/?fullscreen&hints=off">Adobe XD</a>.</p>
            <p class="card-text">As can be seen, the prototype has a very basic grid and only 4 pages, of which one is the home page. We have used a simple prototype like this, to conduct in the tests if the product itself was clear, and if it was easy to find the why, what and how. We didn’t need more for the usability tests than the bases of the website.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">We have tested our website on 5 people, who are all part of our target audience. Our target audience consists of people in between 30-50. People of this age need an easy website, since they sometimes lack knowledge of newer technology. Therefore, this prototype was used and was very helpful.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">They had to know some insights about our brand and ideas, to give useful feedback about our lay-out, usability and product. We started the test by giving them some information about the brand. We told them that we are SPARK, and that we want to spark the curiosity in people their lives who might be stuck in the cycle of work and family. Afterwards, we asked them to first just have a look, and tell us what their first thoughts were. They could go through the website and look at the different pages. We gave them a lot of freedom throughout the whole test, because only then we could get the best, most honest feedback. Afterwards, we asked them to order a €10,-- monthly subscription, and we asked some extra, general questions.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">In all the tests, we found that they liked the mysteriousness that the website had. However, the product was not clear at all, and it was not found attractive that you saw the price before anything else. Besides, there were not enough buttons or options to go further than just reading about the product. No basket, no order button, etc. so that when they arrived at the product, they were lost. The overall website was easy to use, and most people liked it that we used a NavBar on top of the page that changed of colour when you touched it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">What we got out of the usability tests was the following 1. The product needs to be more clear, in different ways a. We first need to explain the general product b. Then explain the different varieties of the product c. Then show the prices and subscription options When using this order, you already warm the people for the product, and the price will feel less expensive 2. We need a scroll page, because the layout was achieved as a bit “square”, or PowerPoint like 3. The vision and mission page need to be on one page, since it is so much alike 4. The links to the social media pages need to work, since they really liked to look at more information 5. We need to add an “About Us” page. They were all really wondering who we were, and why we started this company </p>
