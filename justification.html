And there is always a WHY. WHY did we choose to use yellow? WHY did we choose this font? WHY did we use this prototype? And WHY is this final website so different?</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">User Testing Report&nbsp;</h2>
            <p class="card-text">To create a website as user-friendly as possible, we have conducted usability tests, using a prototype created in <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/649918a3-39ae-4fc9-a5d0-d17c804d8a26-31ca/?fullscreen&hints=off">Adobe XD</a>.</p>
            <p class="card-text">As can be seen, the prototype has a very basic grid and only 4 pages, of which one is the home page. We have used a simple prototype like this, to conduct in the tests if the product itself was clear, and if it was easy to find the why, what and how. We didn’t need more for the usability tests than the bases of the website.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">We have tested our website on 5 people, who are all part of our target audience. Our target audience consists of people in between 30-50. People of this age need an easy website, since they sometimes lack knowledge of newer technology. Therefore, this prototype was used and was very helpful.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">They had to know some insights about our brand and ideas, to give useful feedback about our lay-out, usability and product. We started the test by giving them some information about the brand. We told them that we are SPARK, and that we want to spark the curiosity in people their lives who might be stuck in the cycle of work and family. Afterwards, we asked them to first just have a look, and tell us what their first thoughts were. They could go through the website and look at the different pages. We gave them a lot of freedom throughout the whole test, because only then we could get the best, most honest feedback. Afterwards, we asked them to order a €10,-- monthly subscription, and we asked some extra, general questions.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">In all the tests, we found that they liked the mysteriousness that the website had. However, the product was not clear at all, and it was not found attractive that you saw the price before anything else. Besides, there were not enough buttons or options to go further than just reading about the product. No basket, no order button, etc. so that when they arrived at the product, they were lost. The overall website was easy to use, and most people liked it that we used a NavBar on top of the page that changed of colour when you touched it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">What we got out of the usability tests was the following 1. The product needs to be more clear, in different ways a. We first need to explain the general product b. Then explain the different varieties of the product c. Then show the prices and subscription options When using this order, you already warm the people for the product, and the price will feel less expensive 2. We need a scroll page, because the layout was achieved as a bit “square”, or PowerPoint like 3. The vision and mission page need to be on one page, since it is so much alike 4. The links to the social media pages need to work, since they really liked to look at more information 5. We need to add an “About Us” page. They were all really wondering who we were, and why we started this company </p>
